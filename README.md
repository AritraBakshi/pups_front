- npm run dev — start dev server
- npm run build — create production build
- npm run start — start production server (after build)
- npm run lint — run linters
- npm run format — format code
- npm run test — run tests

Example:

npm run dev
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Recommended environment
- Node.js 18+ (or the version configured in your project)
- npm 8+ or Yarn

## Project structure (high level)
- /app                — Next.js App Router pages and layout
- /components         — Reusable UI components
- /data               — Local JSON data (events.json, colloquium.json, team.json)
- /public/placeholders — Placeholder images used by the scaffold
- /styles             — globals.css and other styles
- next.config.js
- package.json
- tsconfig.json

## Adding or updating data
Edit the JSON files in /data. The app reads from these local files; no backend is required for the scaffold.

## Images / placeholders
Place image files in /public/placeholders/ and reference them in the JSON records by filename/path. See public/placeholders/readme.txt for required placeholder names.

## Tests
If you add tests, include instructions here for running unit/e2e tests and any test setup.

## Deployment
Build the app and deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any Node-capable host.

Build:
```bash
npm run build
